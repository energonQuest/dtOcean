dtOcean
=======

dtOcean: A Game Actor Library wrapping osgOcean http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=2489&amp;highlight=osgocean This creates config values for all osgOcean properties The default actor looks exactly like the example app distributed with osgOcean. Please note that the OnEnteredWorld method of OceanActor has to be called. This happens automatically if you use GameStart / GameApplication to start your app. If you see a black screen: Disable Scene Shader and other shaders, try again. On Linux, the ocean waves have a quadratic look, this is a known bug.
